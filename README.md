# Die PW Woche: Stimmen aus Lager u. Heimat
Die PW Woche: Stimmen aus Lager u. Heimat, [English title translation The PW (Prisoner of War) Weekly: Voices from the Camp and Homeland], was published from 1943 until 1945 by imprisoned German enemy combatants in Camp Carson, Coloradoâ€™s World War II (WWII) Prisoner of War camp. Camp Carson was managed by the Enemy Prisoner of War Information Bureau under the authority of the United States Army Provost Marshal General. For clarification, Camp Carson ceased to exist in 1946, however, in 1954 it was established as Fort Carson and became a permanent military installation, known as Fort Carson Military Reservation, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Die PW Woche is a historical record of the German POW camp experience in Colorado.
